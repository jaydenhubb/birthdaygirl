        <p>Dear Smallie,</p>
        <p>
          Twenty-three, I know the sentiment, your resistance to the passage of
          time, your wish to remain tethered to the golden age of youth. Yet,
          within this reluctance lies a secret, growing older is not an
          obligation but a collection of moments, each one tenderly folded into
          the pages of our personal anthology. In your eyes, I see the same
          boundless curiosity and quiet strength that have always defined you.
          These traits do not age but grow richer, more nuanced, like a
          well-worn book that reveals deeper truths with each reading. So,
          celebrate not the number, but the essence of you smallie, the stories
          you have yet to write, the laughter you have yet to share, beauty of
          simply being.
        </p>
        <p>Here's to you, to another year of reluctant yet beautiful growth.</p>
        <div class="end">
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>J</p>
